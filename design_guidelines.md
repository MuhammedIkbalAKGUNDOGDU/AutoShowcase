- Background: `0 0% 10%` (dark gray #1a1a1a) or `0 0% 0%` (black)
- Text Primary: `0 0% 88%` (light gray #e0e0e0) or `0 0% 100%` (white)
- Accent/Interactive: `51 100% 50%` (gold #FFD700) for buttons, links, icons
- Secondary Accent: `0 0% 69%` (metallic gray #B0B0B0) for subtle highlights

### B. Typography
- **Font Family**: Google Fonts "Montserrat" (primary) or "Oswald" (alternative)
